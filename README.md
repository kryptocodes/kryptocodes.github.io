# Kryptocodes Personal site

so this is my personal blog site + portfolio

NextJS + Tailwind + Notion (yeah as CMS using react-notion and notion-api-worker) 

## Notion 

What's wrong why react-notion when offical notionhq/client is out?

It's still on beta and most of the blocks aren;t supported yet (Image üôÅ)
probably migrate to the offical when it supports all

Currenly using [react-notion](https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion) and [notion-api-worker](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker)


## Installation

Install my-project with yarn

```bash
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
