      <description>Firstly, laugh, laugh wholeheartedly, WHY? because it’s a joke.
So What is Privacy in the first place?  /ˈprɪvəsi,ˈprʌɪvəsi/
a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people.

I have nothing to hide is not a valid argument. Then why does your Phone/PC have a passcode? Why do you lock your apps(especially chat apps and gallery)?</description>

      <description>One caveat before I start: there is great official documentation for populate, from which I have taken quite a bit of information. If I say something that contradicts what the documentation says, assume the documentation is right.
What is Mongoose ? Mongoose is a elegant MongoDB object modeling for node.js.It manages relationships between data,provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB</description>

In the face of COVID- 19, the IT sector is experiencing a boom due to the increased demand for communication services all around the world.</description>

      <description>You’ve heard it time and time again, people talking about a new project that involves what’s called “open source code”? Probably I think everyone knows what is open source right?
 In general, open source refers to any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit. Open source software is usually developed as a public collaboration and made freely available.</description>

      <description>WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media (spam) currently Whatsapp has 1.5 billion users in 180+ countries and i think everyone uses Whatsapp and so recently Whatsapp introduced a new feature called stickers(not new tho) and of course it&amp;rsquo;s turn to be a another spamming feature to spam other DMs and groups.</description>

Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s a new hardware and is not in the Linux kernel.
The hardware is Realtek device d723. This new WiFi hardware is being shipped in new PCs and laptops now. Without having the internet, one can&amp;rsquo;t do almost anything.</description>
