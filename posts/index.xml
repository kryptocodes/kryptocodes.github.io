      <description>You’ve heard it time and time again, people talking about a new project that involves what’s called “open source code”? Probably I think everyone knows what is open source right?

Open source software is usually developed as a public collaboration and made freely available.Open source software programmers can actually charge money for the software that they create or help out with.</description>

      <description>WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp is a freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media (spam) currently Whatsapp has 1.5 billion users in 180+ countries and i think everyone uses Whatsapp and so recently Whatsapp introduced a new feature called stickers(not new tho) and of course it&amp;rsquo;s turn to be a another spamming feature to spam other DMs and groups.</description>

The hardware is Realtek device d723. This new WiFi hardware is being shipped in new PCs and laptops now. Without having the internet, one can&amp;rsquo;t do almost anything.</description>
